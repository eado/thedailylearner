            <p class="text">Standardized testing is the one thing students across the United States have grown to hate. Each day seems to present a brand new test to take. Monday is the AP English exam, Tuesday is the PSAT, and Friday is SAT. What’s the difference between the PSAT and SAT? One is just for practice? Why isn’t just the SAT used? These are all questions that surely attest to the myriad amount of examinations students are required to take. Not only are standardized exams a pure annoyance—they’re also extremely racist. In this meritocratic-based society, it seems like an utter offense to suggest that our main system of determining the cream of the crop could possibly be discriminatory. It’s ingrained in our society to believe that working hard and trying one’s very best is the primary way to rise up the ranks. However rosy this belief is, it’s simply untrue. Standardized testing is racist and leads to a never-ending cycle of oppression. It’s rooted in white supremacy, it currently disfavors students of color, and it leads to oppressive effects in the future. <br><br>
                White supremacy was the motivator behind the creation of these exams in the first place. Carl Brigham was commissioned by the College Board in 1926 to create the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Previously, he created aptitude tests for the United States military. When writing about these tests, Brigham stated that “African-Americans were on the low end of the racial, ethnic, and/or cultural spectrum” and that testing would “[show] the superiority of ‘the Nordic race group’”. Clearly, the creator of these exams did not intend to make them fair—he made them to prove and uphold white supremacy. Brigham also went on to develop many of the Advanced Placement courses and exams. Of course, the current iteration of SAT exams and AP exams weren’t created to “show the superiority” of white people; however, “it still has explicit roots in classism, nativism, and white supremacy. This truth will never change, good intentions notwithstanding." Evidently, both the creator and the creation were, and still are, racist by definition. <br><br>
                In addition to being created to uphold institutions of white supremacy, colleges and other institutions explicitly used them to separate by ethnic origin. It was primarily believed that aptitude and ethnic origin were related. In the 1920s and 30s “scientists became obsessed with deviations and handicaps, both physical and intellectual.” These scientists used Charles Darwin’s ideology behind natural selection and applied it to eugenics-related ideology. Thus, the presumptive objectivity of standardized tests can be used to “scientifically” declare nonwhites as mentally inferior. College officials then took these ideas and used them to “limit the admissions of particularly undesirable ethnicities."" Unfortunately, both the origin of popular standardized tests such as the SAT and AP exams were designed with racist intentions—in addition to colleges and other institutions using them as a means to weed out minorities. Our current-day standardized tests have fraught and racist histories.

            <p class="text">While my previous post talked about the difference in SAT examinations, it's also important to note that availability may also be an issue. According to studies by Soloranzo and Klopfenstein, AP examinations are less available to racial minorities. In the 2001-02 school year, the LAUSD school district had 2x the amount of white students enrolled in AP classes versus Latine students in terms of percent enrollment. Black students in the LAUSD school district had similar numbers. While AP class enrollment isn't necessarily indicative of AP exam enrollment, Soloranzo bridges this gap by showing that 90% of AP course takers also take the AP exam—showing there is some overlap. Not only is this true in LA, but also in Texas. In a Texas school district in 1999, 15% of white students took AP exams whereas 8% of Latine students and 7% of Black students took them. In other words, White students are 2 times more likely to take AP courses and examinations. Clearly, AP exams (which are vital to college admissions and credit) are less available to students of color. </p>

            <h1>Studies show that standardized testing is detrimental to racial minorities</h1>

            <p class="text">While standardized tests did have fraught histories, it would be irresponsible to not mention how they disfavor students of color today. The first, and most obvious factor is that students of color frequently score lower on standardized tests than their white peers. A 2003 study by Dixon showed that for the college-bound cohort of that year, Black students on average scored 218 points less than White students. The Dixon study expanded this to multiple years and received approximately the same result. Clear, empirical data is showing that standardized tests, specifically the SAT, yield a lower result for Black students. Other minority groups show a similar trend. In a study of score gaps between Black, Latino, and underrepresented minority groups compared to their White and Asian peers, all of them had at least a 140 point gap—only increasing as time went on. <br><br>
                Evidently, the SAT must be racist in some regard—why else would there be a clear, significant, and widening gap between minorities and White people? (Yes, Asian Americans also have a significant gap; however, this delves into the argument of Asian Americans being a "model minority"—in which that assumption is detrimental to everyone. This is its own very large topic—one that will be discussed in full as it extends over the scope of this article.) Of course, some might refute this argument—Black and Latino communities tend to be in areas with lower socioeconomic status. However, data also shows that this gap persists in each economic bracket. In the Dixon study, the researchers found that there is a significant gap between Black test-takers and White test-takers in the 2003 college-bound in terms of SAT scores. For both the Math and Verbal sections of the SAT, there is at least a 70 point gap between the two strata of test-takers. In addition, the Dixon study also shows that Black test-takers are more severely disadvantaged in terms of SAT score by a lower family income. This shows that the direct income effect on Black test takers is on average 2 times higher than on white test-takers. This race gap is much more extreme when put into comparison with high school GPA. According to the Geiser study which looked at LA Unified School District students in 2001, “the demographic footprint of the SAT is far more extreme.” Latino and Black applicants “comprised 60 percent” of the bottom 10% of SAT scores, but “only 39 percent of the lowest” 10% of GPA. More minority students score badly on the SAT whereas proportionally the GPA is representative of the population. This shows that a race-based gap is exclusive to the SAT and standardized tests—clearly making it racist. </p>
