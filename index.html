            <p class="text">While my previous post talked about the difference in SAT examinations, it's also important to note that availability may also be an issue. According to studies by Soloranzo and Klopfenstein, AP examinations are less available to racial minorities. In the 2001-02 school year, the LAUSD school district had 2x the amount of white students enrolled in AP classes versus Latine students in terms of percent enrollment. Black students in the LAUSD school district had similar numbers. Not only is this true in LA, but also in Texas. In a Texas school district in 1999, 15% of white students took AP exams whereas 8% of Latine students and 7% of Black students took them. In other words, White students are 2 times more likely to take AP courses and examinations. Clearly, AP exams (which are vital to college admissions and credit) are less available to students of color. </p>

            <h1>Studies show that standardized testing is detrimental to racial minorities</h1>

            <p class="text">While standardized tests did have fraught histories, it would be irresponsible to not mention how they disfavor students of color today. The first, and most obvious factor is that students of color frequently score lower on standardized tests than their white peers. A 2003 study by Dixon showed that for the college-bound cohort of that year, Black students on average scored 218 points less than White students. The Dixon study expanded this to multiple years and received approximately the same result. Clear, empirical data is showing that standardized tests, specifically the SAT, yield a lower result for Black students. Other minority groups show a similar trend. In a study of score gaps between Black, Latino, and underrepresented minority groups compared to their White and Asian peers, all of them had at least a 140 point gap—only increasing as time went on. <br><br>
                Evidently, the SAT must be racist in some regard—why else would there be a clear, significant, and widening gap between minorities and White people? Of course, some might refute this argument—Black and Latino communities tend to be in areas with lower socioeconomic status. However, data also shows that this gap persists in each economic bracket. In the Dixon study, the researchers found that there is a significant gap between Black test-takers and White test-takers in the 2003 college-bound in terms of SAT scores. For both the Math and Verbal sections of the SAT, there is at least a 70 point gap between the two strata of test-takers. In addition, the Dixon study also shows that Black test-takers are more severely disadvantaged in terms of SAT score by a lower family income. This shows that the direct income effect on Black test takers is on average 2 times higher than on white test-takers. This race gap is much more extreme when put into comparison with high school GPA. According to the Geiser study which looked at LA Unified School District students in 2001, “the demographic footprint of the SAT is far more extreme.” Latino and Black applicants “comprised 60 percent” of the bottom 10% of SAT scores, but “only 39 percent of the lowest” 10% of GPA. More minority students score badly on the SAT whereas proportionally the GPA is representative of the population. This shows that a race-based gap is exclusive to the SAT and standardized tests—clearly making it racist. </p>
